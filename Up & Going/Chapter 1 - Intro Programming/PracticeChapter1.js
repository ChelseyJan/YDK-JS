// The following program is used to calculate the total cost of a phone purchase

//Calculate the total price of a phone purchase

//Buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.
//After caculating purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
//Check amount against bank account balance to see if you can afford it.
//Incorporate input into this program, perhaps with prompt(..)

// Declare constants
var TAX_RATE = 0.08;
var ACC_PRICE = 9.99;
var SPEND_THRESHOLD = 350.00;

// Declare variables
var phonePrice = 0;
var bankAcctBal = 0;

// Function to properly format the output of a price
function printPrice(price) {
	price = price + 0.0041; // adding 0.0041 guarantees a round up instead of round down (currency reasons)
	price = price.toFixed(2);
	console.log("$" + price);
}

//Keep purchasing phones (as a loop) until you almost run out of money in your bank account
//This is working as is
phonePrice = 99.99;
bankAcctBal = 350.00;

function buyPhones() {
	var subtotal = 0;
	while (subtotal < (bankAcctBal - subtotal)) {
		subtotal = subtotal + phonePrice;
	}
	return subtotal;
}

var total = 0;
total = buyPhones();
console.log("The total purchase price is : " + total);
// Function to purchase phones until out of money in bank account

bankAcctBal = prompt("What is the current balance in your bank account?");

phonePrice = prompt("What is the cost of the phone you will be buying?");
